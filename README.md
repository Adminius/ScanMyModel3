# ScanMyModel3


This is mostly based of off ScanMyTesla. (https://github.com/amund7/ScanMyTesla)

DCB Support taken from CANBUS-Analyzer. (https://github.com/amund7/CANBUS-Analyzer)

If you want to use a DCB file, you'll need to uncomment out \#USEDBC at the top of Parser.cs. In addtion, you'll need to put Model3CAN.dbc into your download folder.
